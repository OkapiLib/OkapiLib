{\bfseries{Future Plans}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1.\+8.\+x Release -\/ the 1.\+8.\+x will be the last release that works with pre-\/\+C++11 compilers. The 1.\+8.\+x will not accept any requests for any new features and any bugfix requests will only be accepted if proven \char`\"{}critical\char`\"{}
\item Post 1.\+8.\+x -\/ work to improve/cleanup/pay technical debt. When this work is completed there will be a 1.\+9.\+x tagged release
\item Post 1.\+9.\+x googletest will follow \href{https://abseil.io/about/philosophy}{\texttt{ Abseil Live at Head philosophy}}

Welcome to {\bfseries{Google Test}}, Google\textquotesingle{}s C++ test framework!

This repository is a merger of the formerly separate Google\+Test and Google\+Mock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

Please see the project page above for more information as well as the mailing list for questions, discussions, and development. There is also an I\+RC channel on \href{https://webchat.oftc.net/}{\texttt{ O\+F\+TC}} (irc.\+oftc.\+net) \#gtest available. Please join us!

Getting started information for {\bfseries{Google Test}} is available in the \mbox{\hyperlink{primer_8md}{Google Test Primer}} documentation.

{\bfseries{Google \mbox{\hyperlink{classMock}{Mock}}}} is an extension to Google Test for writing and using C++ mock classes. See the separate \mbox{\hyperlink{cmake-build-debug_2googletest-src_2googlemock_2README_8md}{Google Mock documentation}}.

More detailed documentation for googletest (including build instructions) are in its interior \mbox{\hyperlink{cmake-build-debug_2googletest-src_2googletest_2README_8md}{googletest/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md}} file.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Platforms}

Google test has been used on a variety of platforms\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linux
\item Mac OS X
\item Windows
\item Cygwin
\item Min\+GW
\item Windows Mobile
\item Symbian
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Who Is Using Google Test?}

In addition to many internal projects at Google, Google Test is also used by the following notable projects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{http://www.chromium.org/}{\texttt{ Chromium projects}} (behind the Chrome browser and Chrome OS).
\item The \href{http://llvm.org/}{\texttt{ L\+L\+VM}} compiler.
\item \href{https://github.com/google/protobuf}{\texttt{ Protocol Buffers}}, Google\textquotesingle{}s data interchange format.
\item The \href{http://opencv.org/}{\texttt{ Open\+CV}} computer vision library.
\item \href{https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn}{\texttt{ tiny-\/dnn}}\+: header only, dependency-\/free deep learning framework in C++11.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Related Open Source Projects}

\href{https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner}{\texttt{ G\+Test Runner}} is a Qt5 based automated test-\/runner and Graphical User \mbox{\hyperlink{classInterface}{Interface}} with powerful features for Windows and Linux platforms.

\href{https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar}{\texttt{ Google Test UI}} is test runner that runs your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and displays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. Google Test UI is written in C\#.

\href{https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener}{\texttt{ G\+Test T\+AP Listener}} is an event listener for Google Test that implements the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol}{\texttt{ T\+AP protocol}} for test result output. If your test runner understands T\+AP, you may find it useful.

\href{https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel}{\texttt{ gtest-\/parallel}} is a test runner that runs tests from your binary in parallel to provide significant speed-\/up.

\href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter}{\texttt{ Google\+Test Adapter}} is a VS Code extension allowing to view Google Tests in a tree view, and run/debug your tests.

\subsection*{Requirements}

Google Test is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build and use with your projects, but there are some. Currently, we support Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Cygwin. We will also make our best effort to support other platforms (e.\+g. Solaris, A\+IX, and z/\+OS). However, since core members of the Google Test project have no access to these platforms, Google Test may have outstanding issues there. If you notice any problems on your platform, please notify \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/googletestframework}{\texttt{ googletestframework@googlegroups.\+com}}. Patches for fixing them are even more welcome!

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+N\+U-\/compatible Make or gmake
\item P\+O\+S\+I\+X-\/standard shell
\item P\+O\+S\+IX(-\/2) Regular Expressions (regex.\+h)
\item A C++98-\/standard-\/compliant compiler
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Windows Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Cygwin Requirements}
